<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a senior at [the School of Automation](https://zdhxy.nwpu.edu.cn/), Northwestern Polytechnical University. Next year, I will be pursuing my Ph.D. at [the School of Artificial intelligence, OPtics and ElectroNics(iOPEN)](https://iopen.nwpu.edu.cn/), Northwestern Polytechnical University, under the supervision of Professors [Yuan Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6FWhbDgAAAAJ) and [Gao Junyu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RiDA3o4AAAAJ).

My research interest includes video understanding and large-scale multimodal models.
